## First push: Flutter Phone Authentication (Android) Complete
It is the first push covering a complete step of using Firebase phone authentication (testing only on android). The application starts from asking a user to enter a phone number, then requests Firebase to send a SMS code. A user enters a SMS code, then submits the data for authentication. If the authentication process successes, the application is triggered to navigate to a working page.
